abstract = {We prove that in a 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category, each cluster tilting subcategory is Gorenstein with all its finitely generated projectives of injective dimension at most one. We show that the stable category of its Cohen-Macaulay modules is 3-Calabi-Yau. We deduce in particular that cluster-tilted algebras are Gorenstein of dimension at most one, and hereditary if they are of finite global dimension. Our results also apply to the stable (!) endomorphism rings of maximal rigid modules of [Christof Gei{\ss}, Bernard Leclerc, Jan Schr{\"{o}}er, Rigid modules over preprojective algebras, arXiv: math.RT/0503324, Invent. Math., in press]. In addition, we prove a general result about relative 3-Calabi-Yau duality over non-stable endomorphism rings. This strengthens and generalizes the Ext-group symmetries obtained in [Christof Gei{\ss}, Bernard Leclerc, Jan Schr{\"{o}}er, Rigid modules over preprojective algebras, arXiv: math.RT/0503324, Invent. Math., in press] for simple modules. Finally, we generalize the results on relative Calabi-Yau duality from 2-Calabi-Yau to d-Calabi-Yau categories. We show how to produce many examples of d-cluster tilted algebras. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We give a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories, which is suitable for considering cotorsion pairs, and which we call extriangulated categories. Extension-closed, full subcategories of triangulated categories are examples of extriangulated categories. We give a bijective correspondence between some pairs of cotorsion pairs which we call Hovey twin cotorsion pairs, and admissible model structures. As a consequence, these model structures relate certain localizations with certain ideal quotients, via the homotopy category which can be given a triangulated structure. This gives a natural framework to formulate reduction and mutation of cotorsion pairs, applicable to both exact categories and triangulated categories. These results can be thought of as arguments towards the view that extriangulated categories are a convenient setup for writing down proofs which apply to both exact categories and (extension-closed subcategories of) triangulated categories.},

The main objects of study are diagrams, indexed by the poset of real numbers, in some target category. The set of such diagrams has an interleaving distance, which we show generalizes the previously-studied bottleneck distance. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we greatly generalize previous stability results for persistence, extended persistence, and kernel, image and cokernel persistence. We give a natural construction of a category of interleavings of these diagrams, and show that if the target category is abelian, so is this category of interleavings.},

abstract = {Let R be a ring (not necessarily commutative). A left R-module is said to be cotorsion if Ext 1 R (G, M) = 0 for any flat R-module G. It is well known that each pure-injective left R-module is cotorsion, but the converse does not hold: for instance, if R is left perfect but not left pure-semisimple then, each left R-module is cotorsion but there exist non-pure-injective left modules. The aim of this paper is to describe the class C of commutative rings R for which each cotorsion R-module is pure-injective. It is easy to see that C contains the class of von Neumann regular rings and the one of pure-semisimple rings. We prove that C is strictly contained in the class of locally pure-semisimple rings. We state that a commutative ring R belongs to C if and only if R verifies one of the following conditions: (1) R is coherent and each pure-essential extension of R-modules is essential; (2) R is coherent and each RD-essential extension of R-modules is essential; (3) any R-module M is pure-injective if and only if Ext 1 R (R/A, M) = 0 for each pure ideal A of R (Baer's criterion).},

abstract = {The representations of a quiver Q over a field k have been studied for a long time. It seems to be worthwhile to consider also representations of Q over arbitrary finite-dimensional k-algebras A. Here we draw the attention to the case when A = k[$\backslash$epsilon] is the algebra of dual numbers, thus to the $\backslash$Lambda-modules with $\backslash$Lambda = kQ[$\backslash$epsilon]. The algebra $\backslash$Lambda{\{}{\}} is a 1-Gorenstein algebra, therefore the torsionless $\backslash$Lambda-modules are known to be of special interest (as the Gorenstein-projective or maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules). They form a Frobenius category $\backslash$Cal L, thus the corresponding stable category is a triangulated category. As we show, the category $\backslash$Cal L is the category of perfect differential kQ-modules and the stable category of $\backslash$Cal L is triangle equivalent to the orbit category of the derived category D{\^{}}b(mod kQ) modulo the shift. The homology functor H from mod $\backslash$Lambda{\{}{\}} to $\backslash$mod kQ yields a bijection between the indecomposables in the stable category of $\backslash$Cal L and those in mod kQ. Our main interest lies in the inverse, it is given by the minimal $\backslash$Cal L-approximation. Also, we determine the kernel of the restriction of the functor H to $\backslash$Cal L and we describe the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $\backslash$Cal L.},

abstract = {Contraherent cosheaves are globalizations of cotorsion (or similar) modules over commutative rings obtained by gluing together over a scheme. The category of contraherent cosheaves over a scheme is a Quillen exact category with exact functors of infinite product. Over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme or a Noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension (in a different version - over any locally Noetherian scheme), it also has enough projectives. We construct the derived co-contra correspondence, meaning an equivalence between appropriate derived categories of quasi-coherent sheaves and contraherent cosheaves, over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme and, in a different form, over a Noetherian scheme with a dualizing complex. The former point of view allows us to obtain an explicit construction of Neeman's extraordinary inverse image functor {\$}f{\^{}}!{\$} for a morphism of quasi-compact semi-separated schemes {\$}f{\$}. The latter approach provides an expanded version of the covariant Serre-Grothendieck duality theory and leads to Deligne's extraordinary inverse image functor {\$}f{\^{}}!{\$} (which we denote by {\$}f{\^{}}+{\$}) for a morphism of finite type {\$}f{\$} between Noetherian schemes. Semi-separated Noetherian stacks, affine Noetherian formal schemes, and ind-affine ind-schemes (together with the noncommutative analogues) are briefly discussed in the appendices.},

In fact, these universal tilting modules are spectral refinements of classical tilting complexes. As a consequence we obtain split epimorphisms from the spectral Picard groupoid to derived Picard groupoids over arbitrary fields.These results are consequences of a more general calculus of spectral bimodules and admissible morphisms of stable derivators. As further applications of this calculus we obtain examples of universal tilting modules which are new even in the context of representations over a field. This includes Yoneda bimodules on mesh categories which encode all the other universal tilting modules and which lead to a spectral Serre duality result.Finally, using abstract representation theory of linearly oriented An-quivers, we construct canonical higher triangulations in stable derivators and hence, a posteriori, in stable model categories and stable ???-categories.},

Rigid objects in a triangulated category can be thought of as behaving like chain differential graded algebras (DGAs).   Analogously, looking at objects which behave like cochain DGAs naturally gives the dual notion of a corigid object. Here, we see that a compact corigid object, S, of a triangulated category, T, induces a structure similar to a t-structure which we shall call a co-t-structure.

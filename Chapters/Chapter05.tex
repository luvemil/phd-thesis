Let $(\T^{\leq 0},\T^{\geq 0})$ be a $t$-structure in a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$. It is well known (see \cite{bbd82}) that its heart $\clH=\T^{\leq 0}\cap\T^{\geq 0}$ is an abelian category.

A different result but in the same spirit arises for a cluster tilting subcategory $\mathscr{T}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$. It was showed by Koenig and Zhu in \cite{Koenig2008} that in this case $\mathscr{C}/\mathscr{T}$ carries an abelian structure.

In both cases the construction of the abelian structure, i.e. of the kernels and cokernels, relies heavily on the triangulated structure of $\mathscr{C}$. In \cite{Nakaokaa}, Nakaoka proved that starting from any torsion pair $(\U,\V)$ in a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ it is possible to construct an abelian heart $\underline{\clH}$ in the quotient category $\underline{\mathscr{C}}=\mathscr{C}/\W$, where $\W=\U\cap\V[1]$. \todo{Check that $(\U\cap\V)$ is the exact one, since here I am referring to torsion pairs and Nakaoka uses cotorsion pairs in his article}
This result recovers both cases above giving a unified way of constructing kernels and cokernels in the heart.

Keeping this setting in mind, we will provide a set of axioms for a pair of torsion pairs $\mathbbm{t}_1=(\T_1,\F_1)$ and $\mathbbm{t}_2=(\T_2,\F_2)$ in a (sufficiently nice) \todo{Give a better specification of what this means}
additive category in such a way that $\clH = \T_1\cap\F_2$ becomes an abelian category. In a sense, our objective is to axiomatize $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$ and the pairs which are referred to as $(\underline{\C}^-,\underline{\V})$ and $(\underline{\U},\underline{\C}^+)$ in \cite{Nakaokaa}.

Since we don't have a triangulated structure to rely on, the axioms will impose some requirements on $\mathbbm{t}_1$ and $\mathbbm{t}_2$ to compensate. Moreover, we will require that idempotents split in $\mathscr{C}$.\todo{check this hypothesis}

The results in this chapter are part of a work in preparation by the author in conjunction with Manuel Saor\'in and Simone Virili.

\section{Torsion pairs}
%*****************************************

Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an additive category and $\A\subseteq \mathscr{C}$ a class of objects. We introduce the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\A\rhperp = \{X\in\mathscr{C}| \Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(\A,X)=0\}$
  \item $\lhperp{\A}=\{ X\in \mathscr{C}| \Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,\A)=0\}$.
\end{itemize}

Given a map $\varphi:X\to Y$, recall that a \emph{pseudocokernel} of $\varphi$ is a map $\psi:Y\to Z$ such that $\psi\varphi=0$ and any other $\psi':Y\to Z$ satisfying $\psi'\varphi=0$ factors (not necessarily uniquely) through $\psi$. There an obvious dual notion of \emph{pseudokernel}

\begin{definition}\label{5:def:torsion_pair}
  A pair $\mathbbm{t}=(\T,\F)$ of classes of objects of $\mathscr{C}$ is a \emph{torsion pair} if:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\F=\T\rhperp$ and $\T = \lhperp{\F}$,
    \item given $X\in \mathscr{C}$ there is a pseudokernel-pseudocokernel sequence
      \begin{equation*}
        T_X\nto{\varepsilon_X} X\nto{\lambda_X} F^X
      \end{equation*}
      where $T_X\in\T$ and $F^X\in\F$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Moreover, a torsion pair $\mathbbm{t}=(\T,\F)$ is called \emph{left} (resp. \emph{right}) \emph{functorial} if $\T$ (resp. $\F$) is a coreflective
  \footnote{A full subcategory $\T$ of $\mathscr{C}$ is called coreflective if the inclusion functor $i:\T\to \mathscr{C}$ has a right adjoint $t$.}
  (resp. reflective) subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$. If $\mathbbm{t}$ is both left and right functorial it is called just \emph{functorial}.
\end{definition}

\begin{rmk}
  Our definition of a torsion pair in additive categories requires the existence of a pseudokernel-pseudocokernel sequence, while the usual definition of a torsion pair in abelian categories requires a short exact sequence instead. However, as we'll show in the following lemma, the two definitions actually coincide.
\end{rmk}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an abelian category and $(\T,\F)$ be a torsion pair according to \ref{5:def:torsion_pair}. Then, for any $X\in\mathscr{C}$ there is a short exact sequence
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      0\arrow{r}&T_X\arrow{r}&X\arrow{r}&F^X\arrow{r}&0
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  with $T_X\in\T$ and $F^X\in\F$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Consider a pseudokernel-pseudocokernel sequence $T_X\nto{\varepsilon_X} X\nto{\lambda^X} F^X$ with $T_X\in \T$ and $F^X\in\F$, and let $K=\Ker(\lambda^X)$. Then, we have the following diagram:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large,row sep=large]
      & K\arrow[tail]{d}{k}\arrow[dashed,shift left]{dl}{u}
        &\\
      T_X\arrow{r}{\varepsilon_X}\arrow[dashed,shift left]{ur}{v}
      & X\arrow{r}{\lambda^X}
        & F^X
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  where $u$ and $v$ are given by the (pseudo)kernel properties of $K$ and $T_X$ respectively, i.e. $k\circ u=\varepsilon_X$ and $\varepsilon_X\circ v = k$. Combining the two we get that $k\circ u\circ v = \varepsilon_X\circ v = k$, so $u\circ v=1_K$ (since $k$ is mono). Hence, $u$ is a section and $K {< \atop \oplus} T_X$.
  % NOTE: can also use $\underset{\oplus}{<}$

  This implies that $\Hom_\mathscr{C}(K,F)=0$ for all $F\in\F$, i.e. $K\in\T$. Moreover, $\lambda^X$ is a pseudocokernel of $k$. Thus, for any $X\in\mathscr{C}$ there is a short exact sequence $0\to K\nto{k} X\nto{\lambda^X} F^X$ with $K\in\T$ and $F^X\in\F$ such that $\lambda^X$ is a pseudocokernel of $k$.

  To conclude the proof, consider the cokernel of $k$ and use a dual argument to get the desired short exact sequence.
\end{proof}


It is a classical result that torsion pairs in Abelian categories are automatically functorial. Similarly, $t$-structures in triangulated categories are examples of functorial torsion pairs.

The following lemma gives basic properties of left functorial torsion pairs. The proof is omitted, since it is a straightforward application of the definitions. The dual obiously hold for right functorial torsion pairs.

\begin{lemma}\label{5:lem:1}
  Let $\mathbbm{t}=(\T,\F)$ be a left functorial torsion pair in $\mathscr{C}$. Then
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item\label{5:lem:1a} for any $M\in\mathscr{C}$, $T'\in\T$ and $\alpha\in\Hom_\mathscr{C}(T',M)$ there is a unique $\alpha'\in\Hom_\mathscr{C}(T',t(M))$ such that $\varepsilon_M\circ\alpha'=\alpha$;

\item\label{5:lem:1b} for a morphis $g:T_1\to T_2$ in $\T$, any pseudocokernel $g^C:T_2\to C$ in $\T$ is also a pseudocokernel of $g$ in $\mathscr{C}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

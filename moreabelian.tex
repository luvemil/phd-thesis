% continuation of abelian_categories.tex after ab:lem:10
\begin{rmk}
  In the proof of \cref{ab:lem:10} we have shown that if $f:H_1\to H_2$ is a morphism in
  $(\mathcal{T}_1\ast\mathcal{W})\cap(\mathcal{W}\ast\mathcal{F}_2)$ then, after addition of a summand $W_1$,
  we obtain a morphism $(f p):H_1\to H_2\oplus W_1$ which is isomorphic \todo{?} to $f$
  in $\mathcal{H}$ and whose cokernel in $\mathcal{A}$ is also its cokernel in $\underline{\mathcal{A}}$.
  Then with the new $f$ you can add a direct summand $\mathcal{W}_2$ in the domain, but then
  the cokernel in $\mathcal{A}$ is modified and it might not be the cokernel in $\underline{\mathcal{A}}$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{question}
  Can we find $f':H_1'\to H_2'$ isomorphic to $f:H_1\to H_2$ in $\mathcal{H}$ so that
  $H_2'\to$
\end{question}

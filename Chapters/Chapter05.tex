Let $(\T^{\leq 0},\T^{\geq 0})$ be a $t$-structure in a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$. It is well known (see \cite{bbd82}) that its heart $\clH=\T^{\leq 0}\cap\T^{\geq 0}$ is an abelian category.

A different result but in the same spirit arises for a cluster tilting subcategory $\mathscr{T}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$. It was showed by Koenig and Zhu in \cite{Koenig2008} that in this case $\mathscr{C}/\mathscr{T}$ carries an abelian structure.

In both cases the construction of the abelian structure, i.e. of the kernels and cokernels, relies heavily on the triangulated structure of $\mathscr{C}$. In \cite{Nakaokaa}, Nakaoka proved that starting from any torsion pair $(\U,\V)$ in a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ it is possible to construct an abelian heart $\underline{\clH}$ in the quotient category $\underline{\mathscr{C}}=\mathscr{C}/\W$, where ($\W=\U\cap\V[1]$). \todo{Check that $(\U\cap\V)$ is the exact one, since here I am referring to torsion pairs and Nakaoka uses cotorsion pairs in his article}
This result recovers both cases above giving a unified way of constructing kernels and cokernels in the heart.

Having in mind this setting, we will provide a set of axioms for a pair of torsion pairs $\mathbbm{t}_1=(\T_1,\F_1)$ and $\mathbbm{t}_2=(\T_2,\F_2)$ in a (sufficiently nice) \todo{Give a better specification of what this means}
additive category in such a way that $\clH = \T_1\cap\F_2$ becomes an abelian category. In a sense, our objective is to axiomatize $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$ and the pairs which are referred to as $(\underline{\C}^-,\underline{\V})$ and $(\underline{\U},\underline{\C}^+)$ in \cite{Nakaokaa}.

Since we don't have a triangulate structure to rely on, the axioms will impose some requirements on $\mathbbm{t}_1$ and $\mathbbm{t}_2$ to compensate. Moreover, we will require that idempotents split in $\mathscr{C}$.\todo{check this hypothesis}

The results in this chapter are part of a work in preparation by the author in conjunction with Manuel Saor\'in and Simone Virili.

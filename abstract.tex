Given a complete cotorsion pair $(\cat{A},\cat{B})$ in a Grothendieck category $\cat{G}$,
the derived category $\dcat{\cat{B}}$ is defined as $\dfrac{\ch{\cat{B}}}{\ac{\cat{B}}}$.
If we restrict our attention to the cotorsion pairs such that $\ex{\cat{B}}=\ac{\cat{B}}$,
then the derived category $\dcat{\cat{B}}$ fits into a recollement
$\displaystyle\frac{\ex{\cat{B}}}{\sim} \threearrows K(\cat{B}) \threearrows \dcat{\cat{B}}$.
In this paper we show how this recollement is obtained and also give many example of
cotorsion pairs for which $\ex{\cat{B}}=\ac{\cat{B}}$ and a sufficient condition to find them.
